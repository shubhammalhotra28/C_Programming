Start
Estimated Time 00 40
Plan:
implement read_data.c according to the desired output
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	1 30
Observations:
string class is not used in c and we need to include the header files to extract the content within the main file. 
Problems - I initially used string instead of char array because it was taking cstring.h as header file but I realised that it is throwing errors and we dont have any predefined class or header file in c. The string is treated as an character array
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
