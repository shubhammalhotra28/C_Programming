================================================================
Part 1
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
approach - loop till end of file to make a count and add the characters till the max_chars. if the length is greater then max_chars simply increment the other variable(sum) in this case. Then return the number in the last that is i+sum in this.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	00 20
Observations: getchar will be taking the value one by one and how we could use it to increment within the loop.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
Part 2
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
complete the copy and function and call it appropriately within the main with some check condition (recieving -1 from the console ), while pressing ctrl+d
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	00 50
Observations:
i was not able to update the code and need to remove the output file and then rerun which helped me to get the correct output.
