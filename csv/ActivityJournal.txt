SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name:	Shubham Malhotra

================================================================
Implement code to pass all unit tests

Estimated Time	00 40
Plan: sketching the function calling and making the stack trace to check which function is beiong called and used.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	01 00
Observations: I took more time in understanding the question, and took more time while writing the code for 
print function as i couldnt figure what was expected from that earlier.
Though, I had implemented the code with my best knowledge and it is passing all the test cases.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)



================================================================
Test correct operation from the command line

Estimated Time	00 30
Plan: write down all the boundary conditions before implementing the code.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	00 20
Observations: I just fixed one test case that is test case #8 where i took the value from console first and i was not able to see the very first characyer of the string. It has been corrected now.
