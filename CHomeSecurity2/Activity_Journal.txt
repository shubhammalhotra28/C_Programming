Home Security "C" Project - Part 2

Name: Shubham Malhotra

===========  Makefile ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	HH MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

Complete
Actual Time	HH MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)



===========  Level 1  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time 02 : 00
Plan: I just referred my last project submission(part 1), after that reading the project made the implementation quite easy.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

Complete
Actual Time	01 : 30
Observations:
I just added all the code which was supposed to be written within the functions along with the mainwhere i added the reading to be processed.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


===========  Level 2  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan:
Just new to make few changes initially after figuring all the stuff.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

Complete
Actual Time	01 00
Observations:
I was able to implement the required level easily without any problems.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


===========  Level 3  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	03 00
Plan:
I just need to implement the trim part in this where i am just supposed to 
copy the list till the required room number and the delete the leftover linked list.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

Complete
Actual Time	08 00
Observations:

I am still figuring out the stuff. This was easy to implement but debugging the code is difficult for me. I took various help from all the sources which includes the sse as well as from the professor. but, understanding it within the virtual environment is difficult. I tried arranging the meeting with sse for more than3 hours bt still that didnt helped. Wherread the professor told me to look into the node addresses properly as i am not freeing it properly.

I tried printing the list before the trim as well as after the trim to further debug the code, but still i am not sure whats the error within this part. Because if i am following the advice by the professor, i am getting segmentation fault as well as bus segment core dumped some times.

So, I had commented out the part where i had tried to debug and made the code to work as it was working earlier though i am not getting the correct output but it is running and i am able to compiled , so i just reverted back all the changes.

===========  PROJECT PART 1 SUMMARY REFLECTION  =======================

This process helped me overcome some of the basic things as i am more comfortable dealing with malloc now. I do believe that working on projects within the last time of the semester isnt that good deal as i am not able to fully complete my 3rd part due to time issues and deadlines of all other classes approaching as well as the finals week.
Apart from that, it was quite good project where we are just getting the list till my room_event_info which is being passed in keep, further creating the project to be overall the implementation of hashmap(using singly LL).
