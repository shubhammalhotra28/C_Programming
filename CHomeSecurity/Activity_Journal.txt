Home Security "C" Project - Part 1

Name: Shubham Malhotra

===========  Stage 1  ==========================================
Start 
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
Tried going to the code which was given within the starter files and calculated the required time accordingly.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

Complete
Actual Time	01 30
Observations:
I wasnt able to start at this moment, so i took the help from CA for the start as he helped me out figuring out the stuff like how and what all variables are being used within the main.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

===========  Stage 2  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	02 00
Plan:
I tried implementing the required algo which was initially required. I tried figuring out all the required instances which needs to be created anbd called.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

Complete
Actual Time	05 00
Observations: 
i was initially struggling alot while copying one of the array value of char array to other while reading and parsing that but then i realised it after thinking alot, that char arrays wouldnt be allowing us to copy directly. So i need to use strcpy and then while copying whole of the instance to the buffer 0th index was the problem which i was facing as i didnt realised that its an array and was directly trying to assign the value to it. 
Professor helped me figure out my this mistake over slack.
Additionally, I learnt that I should not hesitate to seek any help from the professor or CA.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


===========  Stage 3  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	05 00
Plan:
I thought of utilising the part of my level 2 and make some changes within that while making two indexes this time 
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

Complete
Actual Time	09 00 
Observations:
I wrote most of code within the main function last time which made me slightly confuse within my own logic itself.
Also I added a gloabl variable within the program which helped me to go through the entire procedure and 
adding helper functions helped me.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


===========  Stage 4  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan:
I just need to change some of the code to check the buffer and use modulo operator and update the newest and oldest
accordingly.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

Complete
Actual Time	00 30
Observations:
I was abl to complete the required result before the expected time as i was kind of sure
what i am suposed to do within my entire logic and what all changes needs to be there.
Initially level 3 took me alot of time where i struggled but hoping into level 4 after
that didnt took me much time.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


===========  Stage 5  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 20
Plan:
I believe that there wasnt much modifications required within the code which i was having for my level 4.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

Complete
Actual Time	00 20
Observations:
After implementing all the levels, this was supposed to be the easiest and there was nothing much of changes being required.
It took me more time to take out my commented code and comment some of the part.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


===========  PROJECT PART 1 SUMMARY REFLECTION  =======================

The project was quite challenging upto 3rd level and then i found it interesting
the way it was doing the stuff. this helped me to brush up my skills over
strings (char arrays) and structures. I woud say that the level of
the project is intermediate.I estimated my time after writing some of the 
logical part on a sheet of paper. It was quite difficult to undderstand
the project at first sight as it is not having proper explaination at each point.
I faced most of the problem at LEVEL 3 where i need to go through the 
entire code as i was just writing more of the stuff within my main
till LEVEl 2 but somehow i managed and after figuring all the things, i was 
getting wrong input because os fome logic so i tried doing a dry run over a 
sheet of paper and this approach helped me alot. Actually it saved my time for level 4 
level 5 part. Yes my apprximation of the time was exactly approaching what it 
was expected while ending this project.
