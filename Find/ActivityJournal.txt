Start
Estimated Time	00 40
Plan: Read and understand the problem statement properly and tracing out al the things needed within a sheet of paper
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	01 00 
Observations: I took alot of time in the last function implementation where we need to find the fiurst occurence of the substring within the string and then got familiar of strstr(), through which i was able to complete my program without any failure of the testcases.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
