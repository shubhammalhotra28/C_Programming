Implement these functions in the order below.

Your name: Shubham Malhotra

================================================================
create_node
Start
Estimated Time	01 : 00
Plan: figuring out the logic whil;e sketching on ssheet of paper
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	00 : 30
Observations: learned the concept of malloc 
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
add_node_at_head
Start
Estimated Time	1 : 00
Plan: i tried implementing directly on th system while having the basic scenario odf wwhat i need to do
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete	
Actual Time	1 : 30
Observations: figured out the logic while sketching and taking the consideration of boundary conditions
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
clear_linked_list
Start
Estimated Time	1 : 00
Plan: cleasr the link list and implicitly free the pointer
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	1 : 30
Observations: how we are implicitly dealing with the pointer to free it and i faced the problem first and then realise how we could refer to the unit_test for further implementation of the code
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
add_node_after_current
Start
Estimated Time	1 : 30
Plan: sketching the different connections which needs to be manipulated on the sheet and figuring the boundary conditions along with that
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	2 : 30
Observations: i struggle in this part as i literally need to write and think wghile giving some more concentratiuon. I learned using gdb somehow in this and setting the breakpoints and checking where my code is getting crashed.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
find_word
Start
Estimated Time	2 : 00
Plan: figuring the logic for the required set of data
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	4: 00
Observations: i struggled alot in this part as there were some things which we need to keep in mindd while writing the logioc for the code
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
